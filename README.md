Project Title

We have created an app for local mountain-bikers to be able to keep track of the trails they ride, input their times, and find near-by bike shops for quick repair if needed. 

Motivation

We saw a purpose for this because self improvement on beating ones own time is a must on the trails. We provide a quick way to track, recall, and input every time logged. The other problem that does arise is a bike that brokes down on the trail and we solved this by linking each park with the nearest bike shop so the biker can get back on the trail in the same day.
